# X API

**X API** monitors the prepaid wallet used for X (Twitter) API calls. It is separate from **xAI** inference billing
and **Grok** subscription quotas. Enable it under Settings → Providers → X API; it is disabled by default.

Sign in to [the X developer console](https://console.x.com) in Chrome and choose Automatic cookies, or paste a
Cookie header from a console request into Manual mode. The header needs `auth_token` and `ct0` from the same session.
Manual cookies also work on Linux with `codexbar usage --provider xapi --source web --json` and the existing provider
config `cookieSource` / `cookieHeader` fields. An X API bearer token does not replace a website session.

The bundled `xapi.js` plugin makes two read-only requests:

1. `GET https://console.x.com/api/me` selects the signed-in account's `account.id`.
2. `GET https://console.x.com/api/accounts/{account.id}/credits` supplies `credits.balance` and `freeCredits.balance`.

The console displays both balances directly as USD; they are not cents or the thousandths used by its spend endpoint.
CodexBar adds purchased and free credits for **Balance**, with separate detail rows for each. Missing free-credit data
means zero as in the console; malformed supplied numbers fail parsing. A negative balance retains its sign in the menu,
CLI JSON, and **Balance** layout token. No quota percentage, reset time, or token count is inferred.
JSON exposes the amount as `providerCost.balance`; its required `used`/`limit` values stay neutral at zero, without
inferring spend or a budget. The menu shows one credits section.

Cookie values remain in the host. Imports are limited to Chrome's `x.com` and `console.x.com` cookies, selected for the
request URL. The host copies the selected `ct0` cookie into `X-CSRF-Token` for `console.x.com` only. The script cannot
read cookies or send requests to any other origin. Imported sessions are not persisted by this provider. Off mode makes
no requests; expired sessions can advance to another automatic profile, while manual mode remains pinned.

Use a refresh interval of at least five minutes if the console rate-limits requests. HTTP 429 is reported as rate
limited, without an immediate retry. The integration follows CodexBar's shared refresh interval; it does not introduce
an independent polling timer. Recent spend, payment controls, plan history, and widgets are outside this integration.

## Source contract

The request and field mappings were checked against the console's public JavaScript on October 7, 2026:
[credits request](https://ton.twimg.com/dataproducts/developerconsole/_next/static/chunks/1005-e5d4349396137291.js),
[balance rendering](https://ton.twimg.com/dataproducts/developerconsole/_next/static/chunks/app/accounts/%5BaccountId%5D/billing/credits/page-0c845e065726a121.js),
and [account discovery and CSRF](https://ton.twimg.com/dataproducts/developerconsole/_next/static/chunks/5299-626a890af1b0e08f.js).
These are internal console routes and can change independently of the public X API. Synthetic fixtures cover both
plugin engines; an authenticated account response was not captured during implementation. An unauthenticated
`/api/me` request returned the console's HTTP 400 / error-code 215 session error, which is also covered by fixtures.
